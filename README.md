The final is full ready Robotics arm 

The Sequence to Joining the Robot Arm
1.Table
The table acts as the ground support and is fixed in the assembly.

2.Robotic Arm Base
The robotic arm base is mounted on the table and provides a stable foundation for the robot.

3.Base Joint
The base joint is attached to the robotic arm base and allows rotational movement of the arm.

4.Upper Arm Link
The upper arm link connects the base joint to the elbow joint and forms the main arm structure.

5.Elbow Joint Assembly
The elbow joint assembly is mounted on the upper arm link and provides bending motion of the arm.

6.Wrist Joint
The wrist joint is attached after the elbow joint and allows rotation of the wrist.

7.Wrist Mounting Bracket
The wrist mounting bracket connects the wrist joint to the gripper.

8.Gripper
The gripper is the end effector of the robot arm and is used to hold or grasp objects.
